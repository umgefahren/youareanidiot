# Youareanidiot.org - reimplementation

This is a reimplementation of the youaranidiot.org "virus" without flash in modern TypeScript. It uses material icons and is not as static, but I appreciate contributions to bring it closer
to the original.

For some reasons it only really works on Firefox and Waterfox.
